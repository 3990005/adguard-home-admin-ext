      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 5, 2026</p>

      <p>AdGuard Home Admin ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our App.</p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p><strong>We do not collect any personal data.</strong></p>
      <p>The App operates entirely on your device and communicates directly with your self-hosted AdGuard Home server(s). We do not have access to, collect, store, or transmit any of your data to external servers.</p>

      <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
      <p>The App stores the following information locally on your device:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Server Configurations:</strong> The addresses and names of your AdGuard Home servers are stored locally using Apple's SwiftData framework.</li>
          <li><strong>Authentication Credentials:</strong> Your server login credentials are stored securely in the iOS Keychain, Apple's encrypted credential storage system.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This data never leaves your device except to communicate directly with your own AdGuard Home server(s).</p>

      <h2>Network Communications</h2>
      <p>The App communicates only with the AdGuard Home server(s) that you configure. These connections are:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Made directly from your device to your server</li>
          <li>Not routed through any third-party services</li>
          <li>Not monitored, logged, or analyzed by us</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We recommend using HTTPS connections to your AdGuard Home server for enhanced security.</p>

      <h2>Analytics and Tracking</h2>
      <p>The App does not include any analytics, tracking, or advertising frameworks. We do not track your usage, behavior, or any other activity within the App.</p>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>The App does not integrate with any third-party services, APIs, or SDKs that collect user data.</p>

      <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>We do not share any data with third parties because we do not collect any data. Your information stays entirely on your device and your own server(s).</p>

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>We take security seriously:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Credentials are stored in the iOS Keychain with hardware-level encryption</li>
          <li>No data is transmitted to our servers (we don't have any)</li>
          <li>The App supports secure HTTPS connections to your AdGuard Home server</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>The App is not directed at children under 13. The App is a technical tool for managing self-hosted DNS servers and is intended for users who operate their own AdGuard Home installations.</p>

      <h2>Your Rights</h2>
      <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>You can view your stored servers in the App at any time</li>
          <li>You can delete any server configuration from within the App</li>
          <li>Uninstalling the App removes all stored data from your device</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.</p>
